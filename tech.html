        <div class="box1">Programming is telling a computer what to do.

            Being good at programming means you can make the computer do what you want.</div>
        <header>Get Started With Programming</header>
        <pre>To master programming, you need to learn the core concepts first.

            No matter the programming language, many of the concepts used are still the same.
            
            The first 5 core concepts you need to learn are:
            
            1.Variables
            2.If Statements
            3.Arrays
            4.Loops
            5.Functions
            It is recommended to learn these concepts in the order above.
            
            To fully understand these concepts, you also need to have a basic understanding of data types, boolean logic, and operators.
            
            After you have learned these core concepts, you can move on to more advanced concepts.

      <section id="variables" class="main-section">
        <header>What is a Variable</header>
        <pre>A variable has a name, and you can store something in it.

            The image below shows how we can think of a variable named favFruit, with the value 'apple' stored inside it.
            The code above creates a variable named favFruit, and the equal sign = is used to store the value 'apple' inside the variable.

            The reason for giving a variable a name is to be able to use it later in the code, and also to know what value it holds.</pre>
      </section>
      <section id="if_statements" class="main-section">
        <header>What is an If Statement?</header>
        <pre>An if statement runs a block of code if the condition is true.

            We do similar things in real life, like using an umbrella if it's raining, or wearing a coat if it's cold.
            
            See how an if statement works in the simple game below. The goal is to get 6 when you roll the dice.
            
            To make the game do something different depending on the dice result, we use if with a condition that checks if the dice result is 6.

            In case the condition is true, we print "You got 6!" and launch the confetti. And in case the condition is not true, we print "Try again".

            Here is the flow chart and Python code for the game:</pre>

      <section id="arrays" class="main-section">
        <header>What is an Array?</header>
        <pre>An array is a collection of values.

            The image below shows how we can think of an array named myFruits, with the values 'banana', 'apple', and 'orange' stored inside it.
            Each value in an array has a position, called index, which starts at 0.

            Below is how the myFruits array is created, using Python code:</pre>
      </section>
      <section id="loops" class="main-section">
        <header>What is a Loop?</header>
        <pre>A loop runs the same code over and over again, as long as the condition is true.

            The simulation below uses a loop to roll dice until the result is 6, counting how many times the dice was rolled.
            The loop continues to roll the dice until the result is 6, so the condition that ensures we roll the dice again is "dice is not 6".

            Below is a flow chart explaining how the loop runs, together with the code:</pre>
      </section>
      <section id="loops" class="main-section">
        <header>What is a Function?</header>
        <pre>A function is a block of code that can be reused.

            The image below shows how we can think of a function named greet, which prints "Hello!" when called.
            The code above creates a function named greet, which prints "Hello!" when called.

            The reason for creating a function is to be able to reuse the code inside it, instead of writing the same code multiple times.</pre>
